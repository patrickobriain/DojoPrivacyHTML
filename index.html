You may also provide us with your child's gender indirectly by registering to attend a female-only Event, and we store this data in line with our data retention policy set out below. We need your Event Registration Information to administer requests by you to attend events organised by us and your participation at such events and to communicate with you should we need to about your attendance at such events, and we have a legitimate interest to process this personal data for the purposes of providing the Services to you.</p><p><strong>- Direct Marketing: </strong>We may also use your Event Registration Information to send direct marketing to you to keep you informed of events, programmes and online materials made available from us and by the wider CoderDojo movement from time to time (which is a network of Dojos offering coding clubs and coding-related products and services) where we are legally permitted to do so or where you have consented to receiving direct marketing from us. Where we process your information for direct marketing, we are relying on your consent as a means to process your information where legally required to do so.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>- Event Photographs and Video Footage: </strong>We may take photographs and/or video footage of those attending one of the Events. We do this to promote us, the Dojos and the Events. We will only take photographs and/or video footage containing your image if we have your consent, which we seek to obtain from you when you register to attend the Event. In these circumstances, we are relying on your consent as a means to process your information where legally required to do so.</p><p><strong>- Correspondence: </strong>If you contact us, we may keep a record of this correspondence for the purposes of processing any request, comment or complaint that we may receive from you. We have a legitimate interest to process this personal data in order to respond to such request, comment or complaint.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>- Website Access and Cookies:&nbsp;</strong>We use “cookies” to monitor site user traffic patterns and site usage (such as how a user accesses our website, including individual pages of our website, and any requests made through our website by a user). This helps us to understand how you use our website so that we can develop and improve the design, layout and functionality of the site.
